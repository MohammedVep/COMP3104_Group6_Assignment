George Brown College is a wonderful college which provides quality post secondary education programs for 
students willing to have fun learning so they can get into carrers they wish to have. In this school, we 
have hybrid courses in fall with on campus delivery in Winter 2023 
depending on how this pandmeic goes. This college is a commuter college 
and students who go there have to deal with larger class sizes. This 
college has online delivery options for students who want to learn 
remotely as well. This college is a place for many students to learn to work in a 
career they dream of working so they do not have to make sacrifises to their life in 
later on as home prices cost more and many stuff people want are expensive such as 
new android or iPhone every 2 years, powerful Windows 11 core i7 with RTX3060 laptop 
or M1 Max Mac Book pro and even vacations
